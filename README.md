# ðŸŽ“ New words in English
This is a repo intended to list and describe new English words from diversified subjects found during my reads on the Internet (I'm in a working progress to learn more and more ðŸ˜‰). The most of translation and examples are from Cambridge Dictionary and Google Translate or from the own article. If you find a mistake, please report it to me by using [Issues](https://github.com/rpizzolato/english-new-words/issues) option, I'm going to be very appreciated!ðŸ˜Š
